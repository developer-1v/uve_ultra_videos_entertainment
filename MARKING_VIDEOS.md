1. Chapter Markers
Start and End Times: Define the exact start and end times for each chapter.
Hidden Chapters: Chapters can be marked as hidden, which means they won't be displayed in the chapter selection menu of most players but can still be used for navigation.
Enabled Flag: This flag indicates whether a chapter should be used during playback. If set to false, the chapter is skipped over during playback.
Chapter UID: Each chapter can have a unique identifier (UID), which can be used to reference chapters uniquely.

2. Nested Chapters
Sub-chapters: Chapters can contain other chapters, allowing for a hierarchical organization of content. This is useful for detailed breakdowns of content within a single file.

3. Multiple Editions
Editions: You can define multiple editions within a single MKV file, each with its own set of chapters. This allows for different viewing experiences (e.g., director’s cut, extended edition) within the same file.
Default Edition: One of the editions can be marked as the default, which is the one that will be played if no specific edition is selected.

4. Chapter Display
Chapter String: The name or title of the chapter.
Chapter Languages: Chapters can have titles in multiple languages, allowing for internationalization.
Chapter Country: You can specify the country for the chapter, which might influence how it is displayed or used depending on the player’s settings.

5. Segment Linking
Ordered Chapters: As previously discussed, this allows for the playback to jump between different segments based on the chapter configuration.
Hard Linking (Next/Previous UID): Links separate MKV files as consecutive parts of a single presentation.
Medium Linking (Same UID): Used for files that are split across multiple media but are intended to be part of the same continuous segment.

6. Tags
Generic Tagging: MKV supports a broad tagging system that can be applied not just to the whole file but also to individual tracks, chapters, and attachments. Tags can include metadata like director, actors, description, and much more.
Target Type: Tags can be targeted at different types of data within the file, such as a single chapter or a group of chapters.

7. Attachments
Files: You can attach files to the MKV, such as fonts, images, or additional data files, which can be referenced by the video or subtitle tracks.
Example: XML for Chapters with Various Features
Here’s an example of how some of these features might look in an XML chapter file used with MKVToolNix:
